# 🐍 Python & SQL Daily Task Repository 🚀

Welcome to the **Python & SQL Daily Task Repository**! This is where the magic happens, where code meets caffeine, and where bugs are squashed like the pesky little critters they are. Whether you're here to learn, laugh, or just procrastinate, you've come to the right place!

## 📅 What's This All About?

I'm an intern at Futurense Technologies, and every day, I tackle a new challenge or task related to Python and SQL. This repository is my digital playground where I store all my daily adventures in coding. From solving complex algorithms to writing SQL queries that make databases sing, it's all here!

## 🧙‍♂️ Why Should You Care?

- **Learn Something New**: Dive into the code and discover new tricks and techniques, and get a hands-on with tasks given to you as an Intern.
- **Laugh at My Mistakes**: Enjoy the occasional (okay, frequent) facepalm moments.
- **Get Inspired**: Use my tasks as a springboard for your own projects.
- **Contribute**: Got a better solution? Found a bug? PRs are welcome! @arreyanhamid@icloud.com

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

Here's a sneak peek at what you'll find in this repository:
- **There are two folders namely `py` for my python work, and `db` for my SQL or database related work.**
  
### Python 🐍
- **Scripts**: From simple scripts to complex applications.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and everything in between.
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, and all that jazz.
- **Web Scraping**: Because who doesn't love scraping the web?
- **Gen AI and NLP**: Keeping everything creative, leveraging AI wherever possible

### SQL 🗄️
- **Queries**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE - you name it.
- **Database Design**: ER diagrams, normalization, and more.
- **Performance Tuning**: Making those queries run faster than a caffeinated cheetah.
- **Fun with Data**: Interesting datasets and the queries that unlock their secrets.

## 🤓 How to Use This Repo
1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/GriffinBlackbirdd/Futurense-Internship-.git`
2. **Navigate to a Folder**: Switch to the `py` or `db` folder to find the respective files.
3. **Navigate to a Task**: Each task is neatly organized in its own folder.
4. **Run the Code**: Follow the instructions in the README files within each task folder.
5. **Profit**: Learn, laugh, and level up your coding skills!
